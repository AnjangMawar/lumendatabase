  <p>This website cannot provide individual legal advice &mdash; we cannot analyze your particular website or activity to assure you it is legal. (This is for your protection and ours &mdash; we do not have the resources to analyze every site individually, and we don't want to give the impression that we have.) What we can do is help present the issues as lawyers think about them and answer general questions: Does the law really say that? What is the scope of copyright, trademark, or defamation law? What defenses exist for a given claim?</p>

  <p>Because the information on Lumen is written for a general audience, without investigation into the facts of each particular case, it is not legal advice, and we form no attorney-client relationship with you.</p>

  <p>Sending email to the Lumen project or entering information in web forms does not create a lawyer-client relationship, with the heightened confidentiality provisions of such a relationship.</p>

  <p>While we endeavor to give timely and accurate responses to the notices we receive, we cannot guarantee response to all submissions. We hope that the database as a whole will be a useful resource.<p>

  <p>By posting cease and desist notices, we are not authenticating them or their provenance, or making any judgment on the validity of the claims they make. All of the notices and requests in the Lumen database have been shared with us voluntarily by the companies or individuals responsible for either originally sending or receiving the notices.Â  We therefore generally present the notices in the form with which they have been shared with us.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, we do not host or remove notices or removal requests from our site predicated on the ultimate resolution of any given notice's underlying complaint. In some cases, at the request of the entity that shared a notice with Lumen, we may remove a notice from our public database &mdash; for example, if the complaint has been withdrawn by the original sender.
