  # It would be cleaner to define a WorkSerializer and follow
  # active-model-serializer conventions. However, we rename fields on Work in
  # our API responses, conditionally upon the type of Notice associated. That
  # is not a use case anticipated by active-model-serializer, and it turns out
  # to be much easier to define the work attribute here, and then have it
  # accessible as a hash (rather than as an object to be serialized) so we can
  # use hash operations on it within the hooks supported by
  # active-model-serializer.
